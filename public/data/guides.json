One session acts as team lead, coordinating work and assigning tasks. Teammates work independently and communicate directly.\n\nKey concepts:\n- Team Lead: Creates team, spawns teammates, coordinates work\n- Teammates: Separate instances that work on assigned tasks\n- Task List: Shared work items that teammates claim and complete\n- Messaging: Direct communication between agents\n\nBest for: Research & review, new features, debugging with competing hypotheses, cross-layer coordination."},

Each runs in its own context window with custom system prompt and tool access.\n\nBuilt-in subagents:\n- Explore: Fast, read-only codebase search (Haiku)\n- Plan: Research agent for planning mode\n- General-purpose: Complex multi-step tasks\n\nBenefits: Preserve context, enforce constraints, reuse configs, specialize behavior, control costs with cheaper models."},

Each workspace has its own:\n- Chat history and session\n- System prompt configuration\n- Active agents, skills, and guides\n- Model selection\n\nTips:\n- Create separate workspaces for different projects\n- Configure relevant agents for each workspace\n- Use system prompts to set context\n- Clear chat to start fresh conversations"},
  {"id":"prompt-engineering","name":"Prompt Engineering Guide","description":"Write effective prompts for Claude AI","icon":"💡","category":"Getting Started","content":"Effective prompting techniques:\n\n1. Be specific and clear about what you want\n2. Provide context and constraints\n3. Use examples (few-shot prompting)\n4. Break complex tasks into steps\n5. Specify output format\n6. Use system prompts for persistent behavior\n\nAdvanced techniques:\n- Chain of thought: Ask Claude to think step by step\n- Role assignment: Give Claude a specific persona\n- Structured output: Request JSON, markdown tables, etc."},
